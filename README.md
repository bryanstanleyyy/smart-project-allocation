An AI-powered web application that intelligently matches employees to projects based on skills, experience, and availability. Perfect for internship projects and demonstrating HR tech concepts!

## Features ‚ú®

- **AI-Powered Matching**: Advanced algorithm that scores employee-project fit based on multiple factors
- **Employee Management**: Add and manage employee profiles with skills and availability
- **Project Creation**: Create projects with specific skill requirements and team size needs
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and project overview
- **Smart Scheduling**: Visual project timeline and resource allocation
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface with Bootstrap

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Database**: SQLite (for simplicity)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
- **AI Matching**: Custom algorithm with skill matching and scoring
- **Claude AI Integration**: Optional real AI-powered employee-project matching

## Quick Start üöÄ

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of Python and web development

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   mkdir smart-project-allocation
   cd smart-project-allocation
   ```

2. **Create the main application file**
   - Save the main Python code as `app.py`

3. **Create the templates directory structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir templates
   ```
   - Save all HTML templates in the `templates/` folder

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Claude AI (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # For real AI-powered matching, set your Anthropic API key:
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   # Without this, the system uses algorithm-based matching
   ```

6. **Test AI Integration (Optional)**
   ```bash
   python test_claude_ai.py
   ```

7. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

8. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - The application will automatically create sample data on first run

## How It Works ü§ñ

### AI Matching System

The application offers two intelligent matching approaches:

#### 1. Claude AI-Powered Matching (When API key is provided)
- **Real AI Analysis**: Uses Anthropic's Claude AI to analyze employee-project compatibility
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands project descriptions and employee skills contextually
- **Intelligent Reasoning**: Provides detailed explanations for match recommendations
- **Advanced Insights**: Identifies potential concerns and growth opportunities
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Adapts scoring based on project complexity and requirements

#### 2. Algorithm-Based Matching (Fallback/Default)

The system uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers:

1. **Skill Matching** (Weight: 10 points)
   - Exact skill matches with proficiency scoring
   - Related skill detection using keyword groups

2. **Experience Bonus** (Weight: 5 points)
   - Bonus points for senior developers (5+ years)
   - Partial bonus for mid-level (2+ years)

3. **Availability Scoring** (Weight: 8 points)
   - Full bonus for available employees
   - Partial bonus for partially available
   - Penalty for busy employees

4. **Workload Balancing** (Weight: -3 points penalty)
   - Penalizes employees already on multiple projects
   - Promotes fair work distribution

### Sample Data

The application comes with 8 sample employees across different departments:
- **Engineering**: Alice (Python/Django), Bob (JavaScript/React), Grace (Java/Spring)
- **Design**: Carol (UI/UX/Figma)
- **DevOps**: David (AWS/Docker/Kubernetes)
- **Data Science**: Emma (Python/ML/TensorFlow)
- **Management**: Frank (Project Management/Scrum)
- **QA**: Henry (Test Automation/Selenium)

And 2 sample projects:
- **E-commerce Mobile App**: Requires React, JavaScript, UI/UX, ML
- **Data Analytics Dashboard**: Requires Python, SQL, ML, UI/UX
